# Master-thesis
The aim of this project is to identify immune cell trajectories and gene regulatory networks on a tumour microenvironment. Evaluating its performance. 
Moreover, another goal is to identify genes differentially expressed in order to characterise the trajectories and performing an enrichment analysis.

Code folder:
It contains the preprocessing steps used following Seurat workflow.
Comparison of inference trajectory methods using Dynverse and Monocle3.
Enrichment analysis with clusterProfiler (included on Monocle's3 files).

Dataset folder:
It contains the processed data used in order to perform the analysis.
