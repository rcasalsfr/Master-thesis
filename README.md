The aim of this project is to identify immune cell trajectories and gene regulatory networks on a tumour microenvironment. Evaluating its performance. 
Moreover, another goal is to identify genes differentially expressed in order to characterise the trajectories and performing an enrichment analysis.

It contains pre-processing pipelines with Seurat workflow.
